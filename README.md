## Abstract
Here we produce a new method of reconstructing particle events with atop quark pairt ̄tand aZboson from proton proton collisions observed inthe ATLAS detector at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV. This methodmakes use of a likelihood function to assess a given combination of recolevel jets and output the likelihood that these jets are in the correctdecay channels to produce expectedt ̄tZfeatures. The maximum likeli-hood estimates from this function were found to have an efficiency ofεL= 74.7% in the 3l-Z-2b4j signal region. The likelihood function makesuse of the probability density functions for invariant masses of theW±which decays hadronically and its parent hadronic top quark, constructedfrom reco level data. This method can be applied to future beyond thestandard model searches as well as aiding further understanding of topquark interactions.
